Welcome to Bug Brawler!
I am Sensei Stick, and will be showing you the basics in fighting your way to the top.
In order to become the Ultimate Bug Brawler, you'll need to hone your skills against many enemies!
Lets start with the basics.
Up here are your heart chambers.
Lose all of these, and your fight is over, so be careful!
Next up, this is your score!
Every enemy you defeat will increase your score, and landing a perfect hit will give you extra points!
Be cautious though, swinging and hitting nothing will cost you a point!
Over here, we have your combo
This increases every hit you land. Earn enough combo, and you can perform a power move!
Time to learn to fight! As a rhino beetle, it's easy, just hit A to attack enemies approaching on your left!
Good! Hit D to attack enemies approaching on the right!
Nice!
Notice this little indicator here? This is your range.
Attacking when an enemy enters this range will allow your attacks to hit, but attack before they enter this range, and you'll miss!
More importantly, if you attack an enemy's center right when it enters your range, you'll land a perfect hit!
Give it a try!
Smooth moves!
The last thing you need to know about is your power move!
After getting a large enough combo, your combo meter will turn red!
Press Space to perform a power move!
Most excellent!
Enough basics, time to learn about the enemies you will be facing.
First up, you'll recognize pholcus phalangioides, otherwise known as the daddy long-legs.
Although common, these clever predators will hurt if you allow it to get in close!
Mr. long-legs here takes one hit to defeat, give it a go!
Nice!
Next up is the sturdy scarabaeus sacer, colloquially known as the dung beetle.
Don't be fooled by his foul odor, this soldier will bowl right over you if you let him!
This fella will take an additional attack to defeat, as their dung ball will take the first hit.
Take a swing at this dung beetle coming on your right!
Pow!
Up next is the unassuming Armadillidium vulgare, or as you might call it, the pill bug
Funnily enough, this adversary is not a bug at all, like you, but is an isopod!
They're nimble creatures, and will leap over you to attack from your other side when hit!
Try defeating them!
Great!
That's all of the basic enemies you'll be facing, but be warned!
There are some bugs out their just like you, learned warriors who will test your mettle!
At the end of every stage, there will be a warrior bug, who will engage you in special combat.
Each boss will demand different feats of skill and strength, so be ready with your E button to respond!
You are now ready to begin your quest to the top! 
Good luck pupil!
